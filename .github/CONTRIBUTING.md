## Project Scope

The original typeface was specifically designed to improve character recognition
and legibility for low-vision readers, this was achieve by incorporating distinctive
and unambiguous letterformâ€™s. Our aim is to continue to improve this typeface and to
provide a better reading experience to low-vision readers around the world.

## Opening Up The Source Files

We use [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) which allows you to create and modify postscript,
truetype and opentype fonts. You can save fonts in many different outline formats, and generate bitmaps.

## Issues

When submitting an issue please try to be as detailed as possible, this will help us find the
best solution to your issue. Use an [issue](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/issues/new/choose)
template that best describes your concern.

## Feature Requests

If you have an idea that you think will benefit the community but not necessarily want
to work on it your self, then use the feature request template. If your idea is approved
we will work on it as soon as we can.

## Proposals

If you have an idea for an update or a feature that you would like to implement, then
using the proposal template is a great way to suggest your particular solution. Please
be as detailed as possible because it is up to you to convince the project's maintainers
to approve your implementation. If your proposal is approved we will assign it to you.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's maintainers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing to this project ask yourself these questions:

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?
