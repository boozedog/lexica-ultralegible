## Project Scope

The original typeface was specifically designed to improve character recognition
and legibility for low-vision readers, this was achieve by incorporating distinctive
and unambiguous letterformâ€™s. Our aim is to continue to improve this typeface and to
provide a better reading experience to low-vision readers around the world.

## Opening Up The Source Files

We use [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) which allows you to create and
modify postscript, truetype and opentype fonts. You can save fonts in many different
outline formats, and generate bitmaps.

Install devDependencies on your machine with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    npm install

## Compile Website

On your terminal run these scripts to compile

* `npm run dev` serve current development build
* `npm run watch` watch for changes but does not start server
* `npm run build` makes current build

### Framework

We are using [Rams](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams) as our website framework. Do **not** edit the [core](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/tree/main/src/css/core) files because they are part of the Rams core framework files. However, you can edit the [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/tree/main/src/css/custom) folder files the [main.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/blob/main/src/css/main.css) or the [var.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/blob/main/src/css/var.css) if any change is accepted by the maintainers. Any new CSS file should be added in the [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/tree/main/src/css/custom) folder then linked in the [main.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/atkinson-hyperlegible-pro/blob/main/src/css/main.css) file for compiling.
